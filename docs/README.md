kycDAO JS/TS SDK canonical URL: https://github.com/kycdao/kycdao-js-sdk

[kycDAO](https://kycdao.xyz/home) creates a shared bridge of on-chain verification proofs that enable web3 service providers to deliver products to trusted users across ecosystems and blockchains. Non-transferable NFTs are minted as proof-of-verifications (no PII) to enable compliant composability while eliminating data duplication. kycNFTs are the base for a permissionless identity and serve as a unique web3 version of a twitter tick.
